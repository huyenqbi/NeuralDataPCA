# NeuralDataPCA
This notebook provides an exploratory analysis of neuroscience data, specifically using principal component analysis (PCA) and feature-based aggregation. The dataset of light-sheet imaging was recorded by the Ahrens Lab at Janelia Research Campus, and hosted on the CodeNeuro data repository.


The dataset is generated by the brain of a transparent larval zebrafish. The activity over its entire brain can be recorded using a technique called light-sheet microscopy. This dataset consists of time-varying images containing patterns of the zebrafish's neural activity as it is presented with a moving visual pattern. Different stimuli induce different patterns across the brain, and we can use exploratory analyses to identify these patterns. We can use different decoders to try to predict what visual stimulus the fish is looking at based on its neural activity, finding the upper limit on the informational content of neural activity.
